we always knew our daughter kendall was going be a performer of some sort she entertained people in our small town by putting on shows on our front porch when she was only three or four blonde haired blue eyed and beautiful she sang like a little angel and everyone when kendall was five we began to notice that she was blinking a lot and clearing her throat frequently we had her tested for but the doctor said she wasn to anything at all after the problem worsened we took her to our local childrens hospital where she was diagnosed with tourette it was pretty  because other children constantly made fun of her and sadly even a teacher teased her when the tics were especially bad kendall had to wear a neck  she only had one or two friends but that was okay because they were  and continue to be  real the kind who stick by her no matter what through all this kendall continued to sing and entertain her tics disappeared when she sang we took our daughter from doctor to doctor but all they did was give her medication that just made it worse so we to go the natural route through chiropractic therapy changes in her diet and other natural treatments the tics gradually  in when kendall was sixteen we thought she was pretty much out of the woods  or at least heading in that direction however as if tourettes syndrome wasnt enough for a beautiful young girl to deal with a freak accident happened at a birthday party kendall  on a friend for a piggyback ride he lower than she expected and she jumped higher than he expected kendall flew over his back and landed on the cement floor  on her neck an ambulance rushed her to the hospital where she spent the next week paralyzed from the neck down ironically her biggest concern wasnt whether she would walk again but whether she would be able to for american doctors said kendall had central cord syndrome the pain was excruciating and required morphine to control it sometimes it was so she had to bite down on a toothbrush to take her mind off it as the days dragged on feeling returned to her left side but she was still paralyzed on the right we didnt know for sure how much of her movement would ever come backi believe kendall wanted the american idol audition so much that she willed herself to move again one of her friends brought a microphone to the hospital and put it on her bed every day kendall tried hard to pick it up with her right hand it was more important for her to pick up that mic than a spoon or fork sometimes we all cried because of the pain we witnessed but on the day kendall walked into the stadium to audition for american ido a three months after her accident  we cried tears of joy and our tears turned into shouts when she was given a golden ticket to hollywood as a parent you always think your child is the best ever  thats just what parents do but after seeing kendall perform i know shes one of the best even though she didnt make it into the top kendall is eighteen now living every day to its fullest shes recorded a cd with some of john band members shes also on adness for an original song and video and is having some good success im absolutely sure shes going to make it big some day kendall just puts it all in gods hands when she was a little girl trying hard to be strong she looked up at me her big eyes brimming with tears and asked me why she had to have tourettes syndrome my heart ached to make the world right for my child but i looked right back at her and told her the truth as i see god gave you a pure heart an angelic voice a strong mind and a beautiful presence with all of that he had to make it fair for everyone else
